# Automata and compilers
## Requirements

- CMake
- Make


This are the automata I had to implement. I picked c++ because I wanted to practice it together with CMake.

## How to run

I have two utilities that make life easier `run.sh <target>` and `run_tests.sh <target>`.

possible `<target>`:

- c - for creating the `build` directory.
- b - for building the executable.
- *empty* - for running the executable.
